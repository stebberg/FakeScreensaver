# FakeScreensaver

.NET - Windows App

If you ever need to step away from your computer but can't lock it (for reasons only you know), this app might be just what you need. Simply add a shortcut to the executable, and you can easily create the illusion that your screensaver is active and the computer is locked.

Please note that this is not a real lock. The app can be bypassed in several ways â€” for instance, by simply pressing the WIN key or ALT+TAB, and notifications might still appear over the overlay. This app is designed to mimic a locked screen, offering only an illusion of that locked computer.

Once started, the app will display a black overlay on top of all screens. To exit, simply press SHIFT+ESC. The current time will be displayed on the main screen.
